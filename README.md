### Hello my name is George Swan IV 
I prefer to use He/Him pronouns.

I am a Front End Developer 

A little background about myself:

I attended Kenzie Academy where I obtained my Front End Web Developer Certification as of November 2021.

I also attended Lawrence Technological University and hold a B.S in Business Management as of 2006.

I am currently working on adding more work to this page for my portfolio and have made public my final capstone project as a start.

I am also looking to learn react.js as well as express as well in the near future.
